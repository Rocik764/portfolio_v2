I started with Java and moved into Android OS, however I didn\'t like it as much as I like web development. I started developing web applications about year ago. I consider myself as a fullstack developer, but I\'m MOSTLY into Backend. My two favourite frameworks are Laravel and Spring. As for the frontend my favourite framework is Vue.js. Doing frontend isn\'t my favourite task. That\'s why I rather use ready HTML templates and adjust them to my needs if needed.',
